				<p>Typically the homemade apple pie uses a flakey crust topped in a cross hatch pattern. Sometimes it is covered with cutouts in the shape of leaves or other type of ornamental shapes.  However there is more to our crust than the name alone.  The type of flour, and fat (butter, lard, vegetable shortning) that you use will have a great impact on whether your pie is a golden delight or a messy brown flop. Other ingredients like salt, sugar, eggs, and the liquid in the filling also go a long way to make the pie crust a success.  So in order to never get it wrong I have found a perfect PieMan's piecrust recipe courtesy of <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-basic-pie-crust-47767">theKitchn </a></p>
