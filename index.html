		<p>Typically the homemade apple pie uses a flakey crust topped in a cross hatch pattern or covered with cutouts inthe shape of leaves or other type of ornamental shapes.  However there is more to our crust than the name alone.  The type of flour, and fatting that you use will have a great impact on wether your pie is a golden delight or a messy brown flop. So in order to never get it wrong I have found a perfect pieman's piecrust recipe courtesy of <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-basic-pie-crust-47767">theKitchn </a></p>
